Hi there! Welcome to my personal website.

My name is Tan Zhe Yue, and I am a student at Chung Ling Private High School. I'm passionate about photography, especially capturing the beauty of everyday moments and the natural world. I love to explore different lighting techniques and experiment with editing to bring my photos to life. I'm also very interested in how technology, like digital cameras, editing software, and even phone apps, can help us create amazing photos.

On this site, you can find some of my projects, articles, and work. I hope this space can be a place to share knowledge and document my growth.

Thanks for visiting! If you'd like to connect, you can reach me here:
